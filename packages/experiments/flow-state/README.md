## Roadmap

- [ ] support vertical panning when non-word character is selected (the result will retain one character selection)
- [ ] support Home/End on empty line to swap implicit cursor position logic
- [ ] use built-in cursor up/down command to handle empty lines pan up/down
- [ ] bug: initial pan up/down fails on empty line (consider setting default cursor mode to home)
- [ ] use insert/esc to collase selection
